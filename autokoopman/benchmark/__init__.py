"""
AutoKoopman benchmark module.

The `autokoopman.benchmark` module provides classes for generating training and
test trajectories for benchmarking the AutoKoopman algorithms. These 
trajectories are generated from various common dynamical systems and 
ARCH models using the `autokoopman.core.system` interfaces. Many of the 
benchmark systems are symbolic, using `sympy` expressions.
