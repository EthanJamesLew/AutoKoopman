## Outline

### Overview
AutoKoopman is a python library for the use of Koopman operator methods for system analysis and control. The library presents a simple
interface to learn Koopman linearized systems with reasonable defaults. Also, it presents a variety of linearization methods under a
common class interfaces.

### User Story
A systems engineer / researcher who is in inexperienced in Koopman operator theory but wishes to leverage the benefit of a linearized system. The user may
have measurements of their system with no prior model.
